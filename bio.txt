Well-established in the San Francisco Bay Area, Michael Mejia is a licensed barber and cosmetologist of 20 years, specializing in a new genre of old-school style—what he calls‘vintage-rugged’.
Traditional to the core, Mejia specializes in bespoke haircuts that are bringing handsome back. His unique craftsmanship has created a secret gentleman’s society of sorts, where men gather for much-needed downtime and QT. It’s a rare-ifed kind of grooming that harkens back to an era of Elvis and James Dean. On the menu? Hot shaves and nostalgic banter. On the play list? Chet Baker, Chuck Berry, Frank Sinatra and other suave crooners of yore.But what does the past have to do withmodern style? In a word: everything. “I’m channeling that same attention to detail andthe same iconic looks. They’re dashing. Debonair. There’s a soul and sense of pridein every detail,” he says. Time spent in his chair is time immersed in badassery. Emerge a better man—with your best hairever.
Over the last decade, Mejia’s portfolio and client list has grown to include athletes, Coachella performers, New York Fashion Week models and average gents seeking to ‘up the ante’ on their everyday vibe. He got his start for hair brands Sebastian and label.m, then became one of the original educators for Baxter. He’s still onboard helping to create the ever-evolving curriculum and teach hands-on men’s haircutting techniques.
His portfolio is a testament to his incurable perfectionism, listening skills and careful precision (an inch is an inch—amen). Find him at Mark-Jason Solofa, a private grooming and shave parlor in Berkeley,Tues-Sat. (510) 859-8112
